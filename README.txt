README HW3:

- hw3.sing contains all the scripts for the hw. Basically I put everything into this file and when printing to
the screen I made sure to label each part with the corresponding part of the hw. you might have to scroll up to start
with the first part of the hw.

- the *Output.txt: files are output files from my verilog designs to show that they are computing the correct values.

- I included all my design files and a PDF that goes over some of the design decisions.

- The top entity of my design is the file called PointDouble.v
